## Important Takeaways from the [ORMs and Inheritance Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5HiU7HjTE)

- *Building* an ORM is **much** more difficult than *using* an ORM!
- Understanding at a high level how the ORM works will help you use it more effectively
- The ORM **must** make assumptions about how your classes are named in relation to your database table names
- The ORM uses the inheritance relationship to determine the name of the table to which will make SQL queries
- ORMs will provide instance methods to access attributes matching of the columns in the table associated with a class.
- If a method is defined in a Base (or super) class, then we can call that method from a subclass.
- The `self` keyword refers to whatever object we're calling the method on. This means that if we call `Dog.all`, self will be `Dog` and we'll be using the `Dog.table_name` in our SQL queries.

<br />

```rb
def self.all
  table_name_is_valid!
  rows = DB.execute("SELECT * FROM #{self.table_name}")
  rows.map do |row|
    attributes = row.reject{|k,v| k.is_a?(Integer)}
    self.new(attributes)
  end
end
```

## How does Ruby Connect to SQLite?

The SQLite gem!

```rb
gem "sqlite3", "~> 1.4"
```

<Step>

- This gem creates an object oriented wrapper around your interactions with the database. 
- So, instead of always entering the SQLite prompt and getting a table printout, we can call a method in ruby and get data from our database as a ruby data structure.
- We create a new instance of `SQLite3::Database`, store it in a constant `DB`, configure it with `results_as_hash = true` and then make sqlite3 queries using `DB.execute('SELECT * FROM dogs')`
- More examples are available on the [GitHub synopsis for the sqlite3-ruby gem](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby#label-SYNOPSIS)
- ActiveRecord takes this one step further by defining a set of methods that will generate the actual SQL code as well. 
- The reason we specify an `adapter` when we configure ActiveRecord is that ActiveRecord can generate different SQL queries for different database engines that we might use (like PostgresQL or MySQL)
- There are slight difference in the syntax that different database engines expect for certain tasks, so having an adapter that generates the appropriate syntax for the task at hand is a big win.
- The adapter means that the same ruby code will work when interacting with different database engines, allowing us to potentially switch between database engines without having to rewrite all of our SQL code!

## Dog Walker CLI Part 5

### Key Features we're going to add to our Dog Walker CLI:

- Add ActiveRecord and the relationship between Dogs and Walks

## Dog class
  - Basic CRUD
    - by inheriting from `ActiveRecord::Base` we'll get the following methods defined for us:
      - `initialize` (will accept a hash of attributes matching the column names in the dogs table)
      - `.all` will query the database and get all of the dogs and return them in a relation
      - `#save` will persist an instance of the dog class to the database with an insert for a new record and an update for a record that had already been persisted.
      - `.create(attributes)` method that takes attributes as an argument and will instantiate and save a new instance of the dog class to the database.
    - We also won't need to use the `.new_from_row` method anymore as ActiveRecord will accept a hash of attributes with string or symbol keys without complaint!
  - For the `walk` method, we'll:
    - update the `last_walked_at` column to the current time
    - and create a new walk at the current time that belongs to the dog.
  - For the `feed` method, we'll
    - update the `last_fed_at` column to the current time
    - create a new feeding at the current time that belongs to the dog.
  - For the `needs_a_walk?` and `needs_a_meal?` we'll need to use the methods `last_fed_at` and `last_walked_at` instead of accessing instance variable values directly because we want the column values from the database at this point.

## CLI Updates 

- In CLI (this work is done ahead of time due to time constraints but we'll review it)
  - Add menu options for viewing all of a dog's walks or feedings.
  - Add `list_walks_for_dog` method that prompts user to choose a dog and then lists that dogs walks after the choice is made.
  - Add `list_feedings_for_dog` method that prompts user to choose a dog and then lists that dogs feedings after the choice is made.
  - Because both of these methods require the user to choose a dog, and we've also needed that functionality a couple of times before when finding a dog to feed or walk, we can pull this functionality out into a separate method now (because we're doing it more than 3 times)
  - The method `prompt_user_to_choose_dog` will print the numbered list of dogs, ask the user for their choice and return the Dog instance corresponding to their choice. Because we have one place we're doing this, we can also add in some error handling. If the user types in something that isn't "exit" or a valid number choice, we can show them an error message and ask them to choose again.

## Logistics

- The code for our cli will be written in the file `lib/dog_walker_cli.rb`. 
- We'll have a `lib/dog.rb` file where our `Dog` class is defined.
- We'll have two new files `lib/walk.rb` and `lib/feeding.rb` where those respective classes will be defined. 
- We need to use `rake` to add migration files to create our database tables
- Again, we'll start our cli application by running the following command in our terminal:


<TerminalCommand>
./bin/run
</TerminalCommand>

- This time we also have a `Rakefile` that contains information about the tasks that we're going to be able to run, one if which is `console`. This will load up our code and start a pry session allowing us to get interactive feedback by running:

<TerminalCommand>
rake console
</TerminalCommand>

This will replace the need to run `./bin/run` and then type in `debug` to access a pry session.

## Dependency/Configuration Updates

We have a new file, `config/database.yml` that indicates to ActiveRecord that we'll be using a sqlite3 database and gives it a name:

```yml
# config/database.yml
development:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: 'db/dog_walker.db'
```

## New Dependencies

In our Gemfile, we have a couple of new dependencies here that allow us to work with ActiveRecord in our CLI:

```rb
# Gemfile
# ...
gem "activerecord", "~> 6.1"
gem "sinatra-activerecord", "~> 2.0"
```

## A Closer Look at the Rakefile

We also have a new file at the root of the project called the `Rakefile`

```rb
# Rakefile
require_relative "./config/environment"
require 'sinatra/activerecord/rake'

desc "Open console"
task :console do
  ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
  Pry.start
end
```

This file describes all of the rake tasks that will be accessible to me while I work on the project. To see a list of tasks I can use, I can run the following command in my terminal:

<TerminalCommand>
rake -T
</TerminalCommand>


The tasks we'll be focusing on today are:

- rake db:create_migration
- rake db:migrate
- rake db:rollback
- rake db:seed
- rake db:seed:replant

## Inheritance

```rb
class CreateDogs < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
end
```

This gives our `CreateDogs` class access to the methods defined within the [`ActiveRecord::Migration` class](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.1.4.1/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html) that we can use to make changes to our database.

### What is a database migration?

- We create a file that can keep track of the version of our database schema.
- If we used raw SQL to update our database structure what would happen if we were collaborating with other developers?
    - They create a column we don't have or vice versa
    - we'd have to communicate to the whole team via Slack run this SQL in your terminal... :sweat_smile:
- If we keep track of changes to the database within files that are checked into version control, then when other developers pull down our code, ActiveRecord will actually notify them before they run specs or their server (for a web app) that they have pending migrations they need to run before doing that.

### How do we create a database migration?

- `rake db:create_migration NAME=create_dogs`

```rb
class CreateDogs < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    # describe the change we're making to our database
    create_table :dogs do |t|
      puts t.inspect
      t.string :name
      t.string :age
      t.string :breed
      t.string :favorite_treats
    end
  end
end
```

<Step>

- Do we need to add an id column or is it added for us?
- Nope! ActiveRecord handles adding the id primary key for us.
- When would we need to migrate a database?
- add a column/rename a column/add a new table
- whenever we're changing the database structure
- migrating the database to a new version of the schema

## How do we run a migration?

<TerminalCommand>
rake db:migrate             # Migrate the database (options: VERSION=x, VERBOSE=false, SCOPE=blog)
</TerminalCommand>

If you just run `rake db:migrate` all of your migrations that haven't run yet will run. ActiveRecord keeps track of which migrations have been run in a table called `schema_migrations` within your database. If it sees that a migration has run (the version number in its filename is in the `schema_migrations` table) then it won't run the migration again. 

> We don't want migrations to run twice because this would cause errors. If we try to create a table that already exists, for example, SQLite will throw an error.

If we run a migration, notice a mistake and then change it and try to run it again, nothing will happen. If you create multiple migration files at once and then fill in one of them and run it and then go to the other and try to fill that one in and run it. The second one won't run.

If you run `rake db:migrate` and nothing changed. You need to stop and think. What did you just change in a migration? Probably what you need to do is reverse whatever change you made before you do anything (Undo command in editor would be good).

If you need to edit it and run again what do you need to do?

## Rake db:rollback

<TerminalCommand>
rake db:rollback            # Rolls the schema back to the previous version (specify steps w/ STEP=n)
</TerminalCommand>

When you rollback, the last migration runs in reverse. Sometimes if you changed the migration after you ran it, the migration will no longer be reversible.  So, if you have an add_column command and then change the name of the column and try to run it, realize your mistake and then try to roll it back. AR is going to try to remove the column with the new name (which hasn't been added yet). So...

**Run `rake db:rollback` before changing the offending migration**!

## Association Macros

When we go through the exercise of pairing each of our classes up and asking how are these related? One-to-One or One-to-Many? We can follow that up with adding in the [ActiveRecord association macros](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html) for those relationships. In our case, it'll look something like this:

```rb
class Dog < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :walks
  has_many :feedings
end

class Walk < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :dog
end

class Feeding < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :dog
end
```

In a nutshell, these macros are like `attr_accessor` in that they are defining instance methods in the class matching the name of the symbol passed as an argument. This time, however, the methods will trigger SQL queries and return a single instance or collection of instances depending on which method we invoke.

As with all methods, the reason you define them is so you can call them. So, if you have no reason to call an association method, you also have no reason to add it in your AR models. You want to be thinking about what your feature set is and whether you have a use case for the methods generated by the macros. These docs are also a good place to read about the methods you get access to: [has_many](https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods/has_many), [belongs_to](https://apidock.com/rails/v5.2.3/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods/belongs_to). But the [ruby on rails API documentation for ActiveRecord::Associations](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html) is where you'll find more complete details.

## Seeds

Once we have our migrations and association methods set up, we can add some seeds to our database. This will ensure that we don't start from scratch when we run our CLI app.

```rb

lennon = Dog.create(name: "Lennon", age: "1 year", 
breed: "Pomeranian", favorite_treats: "cheese")
memphis = Dog.create(name: "Memphis", age: "2 years", 
breed: "Greyhound", favorite_treats: "bacon")

lennon.walks.create(time: 4.hours.ago)
lennon.walks.create(time: 6.hours.ago)

lennon.feedings.create(time: 30.minutes.ago)

memphis.walks.create(time: 15.minutes.ago)
mephis.feedings.create(time: 2.hours.ago)
```

I've got this code in the `db/seeds.rb` file commented out currently, so we'll want to uncomment it so we can run it and get a couple of dogs in the database as well as some walks and feedings.
